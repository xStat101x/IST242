It will go through the input first looking for a white marble and if found it will check the next for a black marble.
If it doesn't find a black marble after the white marble it resets and treats the new white marble as the first one.
It then will go through until it finds a white marble followed by a black marble.
It then puts the black marble where the white marble is therefore pushing the black marble closer to the front.
It will do this until the black marble is not proceeded by a white marble therefore it is either the first marble or...
only proceeded by black marbles.
After run until failure, failure being when it hits the end of the input it will have pushed all black marbles to the front.
